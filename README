Collections JS
==============

Framework-independent JavaScript collection methods, for use in
browser JavaScript and in ActionScript.

The Array and String methods use prototype extension; Hash methods use
a proxying wrapper to avoid prototype pollution.  The methods with the
same names as the ECMAScript 1.6+ extensions have the same spec as
those; the ones with the same name as prototype extensions have the
same spec as those in the Prototype library; and there's a few odds
and ends such as String#capitalize.
