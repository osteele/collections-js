Framework-independent JavaScript collection methods, for use in
browser JavaScript and in ActionScript.

The Array and String methods use prototype extension; Hash methods use
a proxying wrapper to avoid prototype pollution.  The methods with the
same name as the ECMAScript 1.6+ extensions have the same spec as
those; the ones with the same name as Prototype extensions have the
same spec as those; and there's a few odds and ends such as
String#capitalize.
